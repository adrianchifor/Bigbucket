# Bigbucket

## TODO

- Reaper worker for deleted tables and columns
- Multiple cell versions (via bucket object versions)
- Support file/blob uploads as cell values
- Schema enforcement at API layer
- Authentication and access policies
- Row key/column object triggers (for Pub/Sub). Might be useful for ETL, work queues
- Start/End/Regex row key scanning (in addition to Prefix)
- AWS S3 backend
